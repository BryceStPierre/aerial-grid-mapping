# Aerial Grid Mapping

A side project using the Google Maps API and geometry to do grid mapping on satellite images of a location. I developed this app back in late 2016/early 2017, including the method for generating the grid.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo and open the project.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `cp .env.example .env` and add your Google Maps Platform API key.

### Development

Run `npm run dev` to run the project using webpack-dev-server.

### Build

Run `npm run build` to compile and generate build files in `./dist`.

## Demo

The project is not live—as to not incur usage charges—however a [pre-recorded demo of the app is available](https://brycestpierre.github.io/aerial-grid-mapping/).
