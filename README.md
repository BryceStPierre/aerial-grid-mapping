# Aerial Grid Mapping

A side project that leverages Google Maps APIs and geometry to do grid mapping over top of satellite images. I worked on an earlier version of this web app back in late 2016, including the method for generating the grid.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo and open the project.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `cp .env.example .env` and add your Google Maps Platform API key.

### Development

Run `npm run dev` to run the project using webpack-dev-server.

### Build

Run `npm run build` to compile and generate build files in `./dist`.
